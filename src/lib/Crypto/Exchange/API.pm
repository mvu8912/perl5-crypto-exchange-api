Crypto::Exchange::API - API module for Crypto Exchanges

=head1 USAGE

Use this class as parent for the exchanges API.

It defines the key, secret which evey crypto exchnages are requried.

The base_currencies is for the exchanges is useful to help to separate the coin and the base token

XRPUSDT

OR XRPGBP

In the sub class define all the base tokens e.g. ['USDT', 'GBP', etc...]

And you can use the below example method to separate them in request and response

 sub response_attr_pair {
    my ($self, $pair) = @_; 
    my $bases = $self->base_currencies;

    foreach my $base(keys %$bases) {
        if ($pair =~ m/^$base(.+)/ || $pair =~ m/(.+)$base$/) {
            return { base => $base, coin => $1 },
        }   
    }   

    die "Pair [$pair] couldnn't find base currency";
 }
